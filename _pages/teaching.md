I am grateful for the chance to teach:

- Information and Databases System 1
    - I provided feedback on students' assignments and assesssed their skills within SQL, relational algebra, and more.
- Engineering Design and Society (through STEPUP 2021)
    - I oversaw the online classes where first-year engineering undergraduates collaborate on projects with students from the College of Arts.
- Introduction to Research Fundamentals (through STEPUP 2021)
    - I supervised a group of first-year engineering undergraduates in their first research experience before their first semester in college.
    - Students learned more about professional and academic skills like how to do a literature review and how to present a poster at the end of the program.
    - Their work is published in the University of Florida's Journal of Undergraduate Research (JUR).
