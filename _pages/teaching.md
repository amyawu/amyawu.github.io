I am grateful for the chance to teach:

* Information and Databases System 1
    * I provided feedback on 'third- and fourth-year students' assignments and assesssed their skills within 'SQL, relational algebra, and more'.
* Engineering Design and Society (through [STEPUP](https://www.eng.ufl.edu/undergraduate/programs-and-partnerships/student-transition-and-retention/stepup-summer-bridge-program/) 2021)
    * I oversaw the online classes where 'first-year engineering undergraduates' collaborate on projects with students from the College of Arts at the University of Florida (UF).
* Introduction to Research Fundamentals (through [STEPUP](https://www.eng.ufl.edu/undergraduate/programs-and-partnerships/student-transition-and-retention/stepup-summer-bridge-program/) 2021)
    * I supervised a group of 'first-year engineering undergraduates' in their 'first research experience' before their first semester in college.
    * Students learned more about professional and academic skills like how to do a 'literature review' and how to present a 'poster' at the end of the program.
    * Their work is published in UF's [Journal of Undergraduate Research (JUR)](https://cur.aa.ufl.edu/jur/).
