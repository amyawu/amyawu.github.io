I am grateful for the chance to assist in teaching:

* `Information and Databases System 1` with [Prof. Alexander Webber](https://www.linkedin.com/in/worldwidewebber)
    * I provided feedback on `third- and fourth-year students` assignments and assesssed their skills within `SQL, relational algebra, and more`.
* `Engineering Design and Society` (through [STEPUP](https://www.eng.ufl.edu/undergraduate/programs-and-partnerships/student-transition-and-retention/stepup-summer-bridge-program/) 2021) with [Dr. Philip Jackson](https://eed.eng.ufl.edu/people/faculty/name/philip-jackson/)
    * I oversaw the online classes where `first-year engineering undergraduates` collaborate on projects with students from the College of Arts at the University of Florida (UF).
* `Introduction to Research Fundamentals` (through [STEPUP](https://www.eng.ufl.edu/undergraduate/programs-and-partnerships/student-transition-and-retention/stepup-summer-bridge-program/) 2021) with [Dr. Regina Rodriguez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/regina-rodriguez-phd)
    * I supervised a group of `first-year engineering undergraduates` in their `first research experience` before their first semester in college.
    * Students learned more about `professional and academic skills` like how to do a `literature review` and how to present a `poster` at the end of the program.
    * Their work is published in UF's [Journal of Undergraduate Research (JUR)](https://cur.aa.ufl.edu/jur/).
