I recently received my B.S. with Honors in Computer Science and a minors in Digital Arts and Sciences from the University of Florida. 

I was previously and respectively advised by the wonderful [Dr. Jeremy A. Magruder Waisome](https://www.jeremywaisome.com/) and [Dr. Christan Grant](https://ceg.me/) in [UF PRISEM Lab](https://faculty.eng.ufl.edu/prisem/) and [UF Data Studio](https://ufdatastudio.com/). Throughout my undergraduate years, I have had the wonderful opportunity to work alongside Dr. Yue Li and Dr. Aikaterini Vriza at ANL DOE SULI, Dr. Vishal Misra at CU-Amazon SURE, Dr. Stefan Schiffer at RWTH Aachen University UROP International, and Dr. Alberto Quattrini Li at Dartmouth College vASURE and Leadership Alliance SR-EIP.  

Although my primary areas are in `Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)` and `Artificial Intelligence (AI)`, I am currently `open` to exploring all opportunities. My past research interests are also in `Machine Learning`, `Computer Vision`, `Natural Language Processing`, `Computational Material Science`, and `Data Science`.
