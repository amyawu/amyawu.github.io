I recently received my B.S. with Honors in Computer Science and a minors in Digital Arts and Sciences from the University of Florida. 

I was previously and respectively advised by the wonderful [Dr. Jeremy A. Magruder Waisome](https://www.jeremywaisome.com/) and [Dr. Christan Grant](https://ceg.me/) in [UF PRISEM Lab](https://faculty.eng.ufl.edu/prisem/) and [UF Data Studio](https://ufdatastudio.com/). 

Throughout my undergraduate years, I have had the wonderful opportunity to work alongside:
* [Dr. Yue Li](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/yue-li-502727133) and [Dr. Aikaterini Vriza](https://www.linkedin.com/in/katerina-vriza) at [ANL](https://www.anl.gov/) [DOE SULI](https://science.osti.gov/wdts/suli) 
* [Dr. Vishal Misra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vishalmisra) at [CU-Amazon SURE](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/about/news/igniting-future-engineers-summer-research-and-professional-development)
* [Dr. Stefan Schiffer](https://kbsg.rwth-aachen.de/~schiffer/) at [RWTH Aachen University UROP International](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/cms/root/studium/im-studium/angebote-fuer-studierende/urop/~wmy/urop-international/?lidx=1)
* [Dr. Alberto Quattrini Li](https://rlab.cs.dartmouth.edu/albertoq/) at [Dartmouth College vASURE](https://graduate.dartmouth.edu/diversity/research-and-education/asure) and [Leadership Alliance SR-EIP](https://theleadershipalliance.org/summer-research-early-identification-program).  

Although my primary areas are in `Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)` and `Artificial Intelligence (AI)`, I am currently `open` to exploring all opportunities. My past research interests are also in `Machine Learning`, `Computer Vision`, `Natural Language Processing`, `Computational Material Science`, and `Data Science`.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
