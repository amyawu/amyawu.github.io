# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide ðŸš€

## What Changed

Your site has been reconfigured from **Netlify deployment** to **GitHub Pages deployment**:

### **Before (Netlify):**
- `url: ""` (empty)
- `baseurl: ""` (empty)
- `netlify.toml` configuration
- Manual deployment process

### **After (GitHub Pages):**
- `url: https://amyawu.github.io`
- `baseurl: ""` (empty for root domain)
- GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deployment
- Automatic deployment on every push to main branch

## Configuration Changes Made

1. **Updated `_config.yml`:**
   ```yaml
   url: https://amyawu.github.io
   baseurl: ""
   ```

2. **Created GitHub Actions workflow** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`):
   - Automatically builds your Jekyll site
   - Deploys to GitHub Pages
   - Runs on every push to main branch

3. **Added `.nojekyll` file:**
   - Tells GitHub Pages not to process with Jekyll
   - Ensures our built site is served correctly

## How GitHub Pages Deployment Works

1. **Push to main branch** â†’ Triggers GitHub Actions workflow
2. **Workflow builds site** â†’ Uses Jekyll to generate `_site/` directory
3. **Site deployed** â†’ Automatically published to `https://amyawu.github.io`
4. **No manual steps** â†’ Deployment happens automatically

## Current Status

âœ… **Configuration**: Updated for GitHub Pages  
âœ… **Workflow**: GitHub Actions deployment workflow created  
âœ… **Build Process**: Jekyll build with Ruby 3.1.0  
âœ… **Deployment**: Automatic deployment to GitHub Pages  

## Next Steps

1. **Push these changes** to your repository
2. **Enable GitHub Pages** in your repository settings:
   - Go to Settings â†’ Pages
   - Source: "GitHub Actions"
   - Wait for the first deployment to complete

3. **Your site will be available at**: `https://amyawu.github.io`

## Why This Fixes the 404 Error

- **Before**: Site was configured for Netlify (wrong URL)
- **After**: Site is configured for GitHub Pages (correct URL)
- **Result**: Site will be accessible at `https://amyawu.github.io`

## Benefits of GitHub Pages

- âœ… **Free hosting** with your GitHub account
- âœ… **Automatic deployment** on every push
- âœ… **Custom domain support** (if needed)
- âœ… **SSL certificate** included
- âœ… **CDN** for fast global access

## Troubleshooting

If you still see 404 errors:
1. **Check repository settings** â†’ Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled
2. **Check Actions tab** â†’ Verify the deployment workflow ran successfully
3. **Wait a few minutes** â†’ GitHub Pages can take time to update
4. **Check the Actions logs** â†’ Look for any build errors

**Your site will now deploy automatically to GitHub Pages! ðŸŽ‰**
