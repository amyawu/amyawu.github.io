# Bundler Version Fix âœ…

## Problem Identified

The build was failing because:
- **Required**: Bundler 2.4.0
- **Available on Netlify**: Bundler 2.6.9 and 2.3.3
- **Result**: Version mismatch causing build failure

## Solution Applied

Changed `netlify.toml` from:
```toml
BUNDLER_VERSION = "2.4.0"
```

To:
```toml
BUNDLER_VERSION = "2.6.9"
```

## Why This Fixes It

1. **Bundler 2.6.9** is available on Netlify âœ…
2. **Bundler 2.6.9** is compatible with Ruby 3.1.0 âœ…
3. **Bundler 2.6.9** meets Jekyll 4.2.0 requirements âœ…

## Current Configuration

- **Ruby**: 3.1.0
- **Jekyll**: 4.2.0  
- **Bundler**: 2.6.9 (available on Netlify)
- **All versions**: Compatible with each other

## Expected Result

The build should now succeed because:
- âœ… **Bundler version** is available on Netlify
- âœ… **All dependencies** are compatible
- âœ… **No more version conflicts**

**Ready for deployment! ðŸš€**
